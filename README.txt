Project 3 - Streaming Finance Data with AWS Lambda/ Hagay Ringel

This project aimed to provision a Lambda function to generate near real-time finance data records for interactive querying

-------------------------------------------------

The Project:

At the first step, I had to create a Kinesis Delivery Stream. Then, writing a Lambda function to collect the data and push it to the Kinesis Delivery Stream. The goal is to grab stock price data from "yfinance" and place it into the delivery defined in the DataTransformer.

The next step was to configure AWS Glue, connect it to the S3 Bucket in my DataCollector. This in order to query the S3 files generated by the DataTransformer using AWS Athena. This step called the DataAnalyzer.

Then, I had to generate four visualizations in Jupyter Notebook. This is the DataVisualization step.

--------------------------------------------------

The data:

As explained, I collected stock data from yfinance of this following companies between the dates Nov Oct 24th, 2022, and Nov 04th, 2022:

●	Amazon (AMZN)
●	Alibaba Group (BABA)
●	Walmart (WMT)
●	eBay (EBAY)
●	Shopify (SHOP)
●	Target (TGT)
●	Best Buy (BBY)
●	The Home Depot (HD)
●	Costco (COST)
●	Kroger (KG)
